  <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Want to start your own pool? Here are the full rules:</p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>11 entrants draft 4 drivers each (from Formula One, Indycar, and Formula E) and follow them for the whole season.</li>
            <li>The standings are determined by adding up the point totals of everyone's drivers.</li>
            <li>F1 teams: Because the F1 points are so unbalanced, this year 10 top F1 drivers will be draftable (Max, Hamilton, etc.) and 5 whole teams will be draftable (Williams, Haas, etc.)</li>
            <li>Formula E teams: For Formula E we won't draft any individual drivers, but all 11 teams will be draftable.</li>
            <li>Points multiplier for teams: The total points for all of these draftable teams (F1 and Formula E) will be multiplied by two (2x). For example, Williams drivers had 28 total points last year, so that would earn them 56 points in our pool.</li>
            <li>If your driver gets injured or replaced for any reason, you will still get the points earned by their replacement.</li> 
            <li>First place goes to whoever has the most combined points at the end of the season.</li>
    	  </ul>

    <h3>The Draft</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a snake draft with the order randomly determined.</li>
      	  <li>The draft takes place in Google Sheets, using email to communicate who is up next.</li>
    	    <li>Each entrant must draft one driver from each series (F1, Indycar, and Formula E) by the end of round 3. In round 4 you can take a driver/team from F1 or Indycar. (Remember there's only 1 Formula E team per entrant, so you can't draft more than 1.)</li>
          <li>44 drivers/teams will be drafted. Since there are 51 total drivers/teams (15 F1 + 25 Indycar + 11 Formula E), 7 drivers/teams will not be selected.</li>
    	  </ul>
